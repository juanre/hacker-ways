# The Hacker Ways

## A gentle introduction to the command line and the UNIX toolset.

The UNIX toolset, like the one you'll find in Linux and OSX, is the work environment of choice of a very large number of programmers and research scientists.  If you are interested in a career as a programmer, data analyst, or researcher, you'll need to master it.

This book will teach you all you need to get started.  UNIX can be daunting until you understand its logic: by the end of the book you will, and you'll know where to look for more.

It is not finished, but you can already buy it from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/hackerways). You'll get it in EPUB for the iPad, mobi for the Kindle, and PDF for your computer, all DRM-free.  You'll get free updates as I add new chapters and improve the existing ones.

You can also read its [online version](http://juanreyero.com/hacker-ways/index.html).  I will appreciate feedback.

In the spirit of making the material as widely available as possible I have made this public repository with the sources of the book, written with Emacs in [Orgmode](http://orgmode.org).  Feel free to use it as teaching material, as a template for your own book (you can publish to Leanpub with my [org to leanpub exporter](http://juanreyero.com/open/ox-leanpub/index.html)), or as you see fit.  I would appreciate knowing about it, and attribution in the form of a link to [https://leanpub.com/hackerways/](https://leanpub.com/hackerways/) or the online version, [http://juanreyero.com/hacker-ways/index.html](http://juanreyero.com/hacker-ways/index.html), with a text that you deem reasonable.
